						<div data-role="collapsible"  data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
							<h3>100% patient-focused</h3>
								<p>Our team works tirelessly every day with one urgent goal in mind: Accelerating breakthroughs patients can feel in their everyday lives. We strive to make progress in the following key areas by evaluating risk, opportunities, and challenges through a patient-focused lens:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Speed treatments that can slow, stop or reverse the progression of Parkinson’s disease</li>
									<li>Speed better treatments for the currently unaddressed or under-addressed symptoms of Parkinson’s disease</li>
									<li>Speed treatments to address or avoid the debilitating side effects of current Parkinson’s disease drugs</li>
									</ul>
						</div>
						
						<div data-role="collapsible"  data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
							<h3>Obsessed with efficiency</h3>
								<p>We operate with a focused sense of optimistic urgency to find a cure for Parkinson's and to ensure the development of improved therapies for people living with Parkinson's today. We won't stop until a cure is found. We're on it.</p>

						</div>
						
						<div data-role="collapsible"  data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
							<h3>Focused on a cure</h3>
								<p>We take pride in all our accomplishments so far. But ultimately we have only one definition of success: Scientific solutions that produce tangible improvements in patients’ lives.</p>

						</div>
						
						<div data-role="collapsible"  data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
							<h3>Risk-takers & problem-solvers</h3>
								<p>From inception, MJFF has invested in high-risk, high-reward research targets; an approach that in 10 short years has transformed the broader approach in the PD research field.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div data-role="collapsible"  data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d" class="mb1em">
							<h3>Different Model</h3>
								<p>It is accepted practice among private disease research funders that the most important decisions — how to allocate donor-raised dollars — are made by external scientific advisors and boards. We bucked this model from day one in favor of building an in-house team of formally trained PhDs and business-trained project managers.</p>
